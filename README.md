# UFOs
## Overview:
Are we truly alone in the universe? These sightings seem to suggest otherwise! The purpose of this website was to build a framework around an existing database so a filterable list could be displayed on an HTML site. The list is independently filterable by date, city, state, country, and shape of sighting.
## Results:
To preform a search simply input search terms into the filter boxes. You may input as many filters as is needed. Once enter is pushed or the box is clicked out of, the dataframe will update to show the filtered items.
## Summary: 
In summary, this site is a great tool for filtering the existing list of sightings. One draw back of the website is it will have to be manually updated to add any additional sightings. There could also be further filtering added to search by duration or comments about the sighting. Further development could be to add a feature that made predictive guesses when search terms are being enetered. It would also be nice if the site had a way for users to submit new sightings to be added to the database.
